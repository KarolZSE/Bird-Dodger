# Bird Dodger
Pilot ! You've got to save us! We've just flown into a flock of birds! Please maneuver us around them I will try to help you I'll by calling out their positions, steer us to safety, before it's too late! 

# What's the game about:
You have to dodge the birds, while piloting a hot air ballon. The birds have special powers:
-  Blue Bird goes straight  
-  Red Bird goes in zig zags  
-  Yellow bird returns back  
-  Green bird is super fast
You can move the ballon along the X-axis with the mouse. 
You can press the spacebar to make the ballon float upward (be careful, it takes time to fall back down)
There is a scoreboard system that saves your score to database (you can see the leaderboard on the right)
